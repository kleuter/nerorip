neorip version 0.2
Report all bugs at https://github.com/scallopedllama/nerorip

nerorip takes a nero image file (.nrt extension) as input
and attempts to extract the track data as either ISO or audio data.

Version 0.2 essentially only prints image information after parsing the nero image chunks
into an internal data structure.
The usage below is all implemented but the output description below explains how it will
work in the future.


Usage: ./nerorip [OPTIONS]... [INPUT FILE] [OUTPUT DIRECTORY]

  -i, --info            Only disply information about the image file, do not rip
  -v, --verbose         Increment program verbosity by one tick
  -q, --quiet           Decrement program verbosity by one tick
                        Verbosity starts at 1, a verbosity of 0 will print nothing.
  -h, --help            Display this help message and exit
      --version         Output version information and exit.

If output directory is omitted, image data is put in the same directory as the input file.

For each track found in the image, nerorip will output the following:
  one iso file named "data.sSStTT.iso" if the track is data and
  one wav file named "audio.sSStTT.wav" if the track is audio
where SS is the session number and TT is the track number.
Also, for each session in the iamge, nerorip will output one cue file.For example, if your disc image is like the following
  Session 1:
    Track 1: Audio
    Track 2: Data
  Session 2:
    Track 1: Data
nerorip will output the following files:
  audio.s01t01.wav, data.s01t02.iso, data.s02t03.iso, session01.cue, session02.cue
Note that the track number does not reset between sessions.

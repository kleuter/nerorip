neorip version 0.1
Report all bugs at https://github.com/scallopedllama/nerorip

Nero Image Ripper takes a nero image file (.nrt extension) as input
and attempts to extract the track data as either ISO or audio data.

Version 0.1 essentially only prints image information while parsing the nero image chunks.
The usage below (and what is printed without input) describes how it will work in the future.

Usage: ./nerorip [OPTIONS]... [INPUT FILE] [OUTPUT DIRECTORY]

  -i, --info            Only disply information about the image file, do not rip
  -h, --help            Display this help message and exit
  -v, --version         Output version information and exit.

If output directory is omitted, image data is put in the same directory as the input file.

For each track found in the image, Nero Image Ripper will output the following:
  one iso file named "data.sSStTT.iso" if the track is data and
  one wav file named "audio.sSStTT.wav" if the track is audio
where SS is the session number and TT is the track number.

For example, if your disc image is like the following
  Session 1:
    Track 1: Audio
    Track 2: Data
  Session 2:
    Track 1: Data
the Nero Image Ripper will output the following files:
  audio.s01t01.wav, data.s01t02.iso, data.s02t03.iso
Note that the track number does not reset between sessions.
